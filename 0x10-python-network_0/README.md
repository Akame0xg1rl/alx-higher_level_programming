HTTP and HTTP Cookies
Overview
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.

HTTP Cookies are small pieces of data sent from a website and stored on a user's device while the user is browsing. They are used to remember stateful information and track user behavior.

Key Concepts
HTTP Methods
HTTP defines several methods (or verbs) that indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. Common methods include:

GET: Retrieve data from a server
POST: Send data to a server for processing
PUT: Update a resource on the server
DELETE: Remove a resource from the server
HEAD: Retrieve headers similar to GET but without the response body
OPTIONS: Determine the communication options for the target resource
HTTP Headers
Headers provide additional information about the request or response. Examples include:

Content-Type: Specifies the media type of the resource
Cache-Control: Directs caches on how to behave
User-Agent: Identifies the client software initiating the request
HTTP Status Codes
Status codes indicate the outcome of an HTTP request. Examples include:

200 OK: Request succeeded
404 Not Found: Resource not found
500 Internal Server Error: Server encountered an unexpected condition
HTTP Cookies
HTTP Cookies are used for session management, user authentication, and tracking. They consist of:

Name: The name of the cookie
Value: The value stored within the cookie
Domain and Path: Specifies the scope of the cookie
Expiry: Determines when the cookie will be automatically deleted
Usage
Understanding HTTP and HTTP cookies is crucial for web developers and system administrators to build and maintain efficient and secure web applications.
